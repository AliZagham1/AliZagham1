## 🚀 My Journey into Tech

My journey into computer science started with a spark of curiosity. In high school, I took my first CS class and became fascinated with how computers work behind the scenes. It amazed me how programs, logic, and coding come together to power the technology we rely on every day. The idea that complex logic and hours of coding can lead to impactful solutions truly captivated me.
